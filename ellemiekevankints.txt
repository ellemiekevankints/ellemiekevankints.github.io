My favorite quote, "<span id="k">The best way to predict the future is to create it</span>." <!-- sjkfhskjf -->

Hey there! My name is Ellemieke Van Kints (pronounced 'ella-meek').<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p>I am a Computer Vision Research Engineer at NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California. I currently work on the Neural Radiance Methods project, where I build custom Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) pipelines for reconstructing and relighting craters on the lunar surface. Additionally, I lead the development of the Total Electron Content (TEC) App for the Distributed Spacecraft Autonomy (DSA) mission, a software payload onboard the NASA Starling satellite swarm. The TEC App uses GPS signals from Starling to measure electron density in the ionosphere, and my work helped improve these scientific calculations.</p> <!-- ksjdokhdfgdufdfkjhfkjahdfkjhafkjhakfajasdfghjhgfkdlkfdadksalakfjla -->
<p>I earned my Bachlor's in Computer Science and Masterâ€™s in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Georgia. My Master's Thesis focused on appliying state-of-the-art NeRF methods to reconstruct and estimate the mass balance of critically endangered glaciers. During my time in undergrad, I was apart of the UGA Small Satellite Research Laboratory (SSRL), where I served as Payload Software Lead for the Multiview Onboard Computational Imager (MOCI) CubeSat mission. My work focused on developing GPU-accelerated computer vision systems to process images directly onboard the satellite.</p> <!-- kjdhjhgdgldjhgdwtoiewotwotjdfkjdfffsfjaksaflsflkdflklfalafakdjdskj -->
<p>I have a strong background in image processing, deep learning, and neural rendering, especially for 3D vision and remote sensing applications. I am particularly passionate about mapping planetary bodies to support human exploration of our solar system and beyond.</p> !-- kjdhjhgdgldjhgdwtoiewotwotjdfkjdfffsfjaksaflsflkdflklfalafakdjdskj -->
<p>In my free time, I like to play chess, practice yoga, and read science fiction novels. I'm currently reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/672244.Helliconia_Spring"> Helliconia Spring</a>.
